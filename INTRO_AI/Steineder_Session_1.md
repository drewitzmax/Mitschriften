# AI & Data Science
## Exam
- 2 Part Exam
- each part must be positive on its own
- retests may be on one part only

## Data Science
- Statistics - descriptive statistics
- Propability
- inferential statistics

## AI
Any algorithm that mimics intelligent behaviour.
- algorithms
  - linear regression
  - logistic regression
- machine learning
  - optimization

## Statistics
**Population:** all objects of interest

**Sample:** concrete subset of population

**dataset:** measured characteristics of  each object in a sample

**T**

1. get a feeling / understand the dataset
   - Optimization
   - propability
2. infereatial statistics
   - Draw conclusions from the dataset

### Descriptive Statistics
#### Types of Data
- quantitative data
- qualitative data
  - categorial data
---
- discret data
  - a few => can be presented as a (reasonably long) list
- continuous data
  - many => infinitely many
---
- nominal data
  - no order
- ordinal
  - order
- interval
  - differentes make sense
- rational
  - fractions make sense

Summing up data
- numerical measurements
  - center of the data
    - average value
      - -x
    - median value
      - ~x
    - mode
      - value with most occurrences
      - not unique
      - x_mod
    - variability measurment
      - range
        - x_max - x_min
      - variance
        - MSE
          - Mean Squared Error
          - avarage of the squared difference of all values from the average value
          - sqrt(MSE) = standart deveiation

    - position in dataset
      - quantiles
        - ~~alpha-quantile~~
- graphical methods
  - histogramms
