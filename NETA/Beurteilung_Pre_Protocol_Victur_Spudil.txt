Pros:
+ I like that the network is fully planned out and every device has already a fixed IP and the Network configuration for every host is clear
+ Needed commands are all there

Cons:
- I would suggest to sepparate the IP range into a server range and a client range to minimize potential conflicts and introduce some order
- Way to much redundant information was introduced by copying the whole document into the protocol
